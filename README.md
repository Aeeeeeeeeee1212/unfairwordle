It is possible to win though :)

## How to play

[Play it here](https://tweakimp.github.io/unfairwordle/)

Try to guess an english five letter word with six tries.  
You can only submit valid five letter words.

After you submitted your guess, the tiles will indicate which letter is not in the word (grey), which letter is in the word at a different position (yellow) and which letter is at the correct spot (green).

## Used words

Possible guesses and target word lists are from the original wordle.
